The Snake game is a classic video game that involves guiding a snake around a playing field, collecting food and avoiding obstacles, until the snake grows too long and collides with itself or a wall. Here are some basic steps to create a simple version of the game:

Set up the game board: Create a playing field with a grid of cells, where the snake and food can move around.

Create the snake: Define the snake as a series of cells that are initially positioned at a starting point on the game board. The snake should move in one direction at a time and its body should grow as it eats food.

Add food: Generate food randomly on the game board. When the snake eats the food, it should grow longer.

Implement movement: Allow the player to control the direction of the snake's movement using arrow keys or other input methods. Each time the snake moves, its body should follow its head.

Add collision detection: Check for collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries, as well as collisions between the snake's head and its body.

Add scoring: Keep track of the player's score as they eat food and grow the snake.

Game over conditions: End the game if the snake collides with a wall or its own body. Display the player's final score and allow them to restart the game.
